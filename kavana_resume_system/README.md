# Resume System (Backend)

## 📘 Project Overview
The Resume System is a backend application developed using Spring Boot and SQL Server.
It is part of a larger career ecosystem that helps students and professionals automatically build and manage their resumes.
This backend stores user data, achievements, projects, and skills, and allows users to upload and download resumes securely.
All resume-related information is handled through REST APIs, making it easy to integrate with frontend platforms or AI modules that auto-generate professional resumes.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Java 17  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Data JPA  
- SQL Server  
- REST APIs  
- Postman for API testing

## 🧩 Modules Implemented
- **User Module** – Handles user registration and login  
- **Achievement Module** – Stores user achievements  
- **Skills Module** – Stores and updates user skills  
- **Projects Module** – Stores project details
- **Course Module** -- Stores and manage details of the courses completed by the user
- **Resume Module** – Uploads and downloads resumes (PDF, DOCX)

## 🧠 Approach
I developed backend REST APIs using Spring Boot.  
Data is stored in SQL Server through JPA Entities.  
The Resume upload and download feature allows users to manage files securely.  
I tested endpoints using Postman and structured the project for future frontend integration.
